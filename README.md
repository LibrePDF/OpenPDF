## Background

OpenPDF is open source software with a LGPL and MPL license. It is a fork of iText version 4, more
specifically iText svn tag 4.2.0, which was hosted publicly on sourceforge with LGPL and MPL license
headers in the source code, and LGPL and MPL license documents in the svn repository. Beginning with
version 5.0 of iText, the developers have moved to the AGPL to improve their ability to sell
commercial licenses.

  <version>${openpdf.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

### Supporting complex glyph substitution/ Ligature substitution

OpenPDF supports glyph substitution which is required for correct rendering of fonts ligature substitution requirements.
FOP dependency is required to enable this feature. Refer following wiki for
details: [wiki](https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/wiki/Multi-byte-character-language-support-with-TTF-fonts)

  dependency)
  - Provider (`org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk18on` or `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-ext-jdk18on` depending
    on which algorithm you are using)
  - PKIX/CMS (`org.bouncycastle:bcpkix-jdk18on`)
