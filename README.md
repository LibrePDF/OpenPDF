## Background ##

OpenPDF is open source software with a LGPL and MPL license. It is a fork of iText version 4, more
specifically iText svn tag 4.2.0, which was hosted publicly on sourceforge with LGPL and MPL license
headers in the source code, and LGPL and MPL license documents in the svn repository. Beginning with
version 5.0 of iText, the developers have moved to the AGPL to improve their ability to sell
commercial licenses.

## Contributing ##

Release the hounds!  Please send all pull requests. Make sure that your contributions can be
released with a dual LGPL and MPL license. In particular, pull requests to the OpenPDF project must

### Coding Style ###

- Code indentation style is 4 spaces.
- Generally try to preserve the coding style in the file you are modifying.

## Dependencies ##

### Required Dependencies: ###

- Java 8 or later is required to use OpenPDF. All versions Java 8 to Java OpenJDK 15 have been
  tested to work.

### UTF-8 Fonts: ###

As of 1.3.21 the UTF-8 Liberation fonts moved to its own module, to reduce the size of the OpenPDF
jar. If you want to use the bundled UTF-8 fonts, please add the following dependency to your project
and use the class `org.librepdf.openpdf.fonts.Liberation`.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.librepdf</groupId>
  <artifactId>openpdf-fonts-extra</artifactId>
  <version>${openpdf.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

### Supporting complex glyph substitution/ Ligature substitution: ###

OpenPDF supports glyph substitution which is required for correct rendering of fonts ligature substitution requirements.
FOP dependency is required to enable this feature. Refer following wiki for
details: [wiki](https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/wiki/Multi-byte-character-language-support-with-TTF-fonts)

### Supporting OpenType layout, glyph positioning, reordering and substitution: ###

OpenPDF supports OpenType layout, glyph positioning, reordering and substitution which is e.g. required for correct
positioning of accents, the rendering of non-Latin and right-to-left scripts. OpenPDF supports DIN 91379.
See: [wiki](https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/wiki/Accents,-DIN-91379,-non-Latin-scripts)

### Optional: ###

- [BouncyCastle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/) (BouncyCastle is used to sign PDF files, so it's a recommended
  dependency)
    - Provider (`org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk18on` or `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-ext-jdk18on` depending
      on which algorithm you are using)
    - PKIX/CMS (`org.bouncycastle:bcpkix-jdk18on`)
- Apache FOP (`org.apache.xmlgraphics:fop`)
- Tiff support: Java versions prior to 9 require an additional library in the classpath to handle tiff images. Options are:
    - https://github.com/haraldk/TwelveMonkeys
    - https://github.com/jai-imageio/jai-imageio-core
- Please refer to our [pom.xml](pom.xml) to see what version is needed.
