XML Entity Declarations for Characters

The character entity sets distributed with DocBook XML are direct
copies of the official entities located at

  http://www.w3.org/2003/entities/

They are distributed for historical compatibility and user convenience.
The DocBook Technical Committee no longer attempts to maintain these
definitions and will periodically update them from the W3C site if and
as they are updated there.

Please direct all questions or comments about the entities to the
individuals or working groups who maintain the official sets.
