    <PROLOGUE>
      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Two households, both alike in dignity,</LINE>
        <LINE>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</LINE>
        <LINE>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</LINE>
        <LINE>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</LINE>
        <LINE>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</LINE>
        <LINE>A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;</LINE>
        <LINE>Whole misadventured piteous overthrows</LINE>
        <LINE>Do with their death bury their parents' strife.</LINE>
        <LINE>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,</LINE>
        <LINE>And the continuance of their parents' rage,</LINE>
        <LINE>Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,</LINE>
        <LINE>Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;</LINE>
        <LINE>The which if you with patient ears attend,</LINE>
        <LINE>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</LINE>

    <SCENE>
      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>No, for then we should be colliers.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>I strike quickly, being moved.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>But thou art not quickly moved to strike.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:</LINE>
        <LINE>therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will</LINE>
        <LINE>take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes</LINE>
        <LINE>to the wall.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,</LINE>
        <LINE>are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push</LINE>
        <LINE>Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids</LINE>
        <LINE>to the wall.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I</LINE>
        <LINE>have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the</LINE>
        <LINE>maids, and cut off their heads.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>The heads of the maids?</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;</LINE>
        <LINE>take it in what sense thou wilt.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>They must take it in sense that feel it.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and</LINE>
        <LINE>'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>SAMPSON</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou</LINE>
        <LINE>hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes</LINE>
        <LINE>two of the house of the Montagues.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.</LINE>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as</LINE>
        <LINE>they list.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>GREGORY</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;</LINE>
        <LINE>which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,</LINE>
        <LINE>As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>LADY CAPULET</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

        <LINE>My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>

        <SPEAKER>LADY MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,</LINE>
        <LINE>Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--</LINE>
        <LINE>Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,</LINE>
        <LINE>That quench the fire of your pernicious rage</LINE>
        <LINE>With purple fountains issuing from your veins,</LINE>
        <LINE>On pain of torture, from those bloody hands</LINE>
        <LINE>Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,</LINE>
        <LINE>And hear the sentence of your moved prince.</LINE>
        <LINE>Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,</LINE>
        <LINE>By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,</LINE>
        <LINE>Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,</LINE>
        <LINE>And made Verona's ancient citizens</LINE>
        <LINE>Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,</LINE>
        <LINE>To wield old partisans, in hands as old,</LINE>
        <LINE>Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:</LINE>
        <LINE>If ever you disturb our streets again,</LINE>
        <LINE>Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.</LINE>
        <LINE>For this time, all the rest depart away:</LINE>
        <LINE>You Capulet; shall go along with me:</LINE>
        <LINE>And, Montague, come you this afternoon,</LINE>
        <LINE>To know our further pleasure in this case,</LINE>
        <LINE>To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.</LINE>
        <LINE>Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?</LINE>
        <LINE>Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>
      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Here were the servants of your adversary,</LINE>
        <LINE>And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:</LINE>
        <LINE>I drew to part them: in the instant came</LINE>
        <LINE>The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,</LINE>
        <LINE>Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,</LINE>
        <LINE>He swung about his head and cut the winds,</LINE>
        <LINE>Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:</LINE>
        <LINE>While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,</LINE>
        <LINE>Came more and more and fought on part and part,</LINE>
        <LINE>Till the prince came, who parted either part.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?</LINE>
        <LINE>Right glad I am he was not at this fray.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>LADY MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>


      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun</LINE>
        <LINE>Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,</LINE>
        <LINE>A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;</LINE>
        <LINE>Where, underneath the grove of sycamore</LINE>
        <LINE>That westward rooteth from the city's side,</LINE>
        <LINE>So early walking did I see your son:</LINE>
        <LINE>Towards him I made, but he was ware of me</LINE>
        <LINE>And stole into the covert of the wood:</LINE>
        <LINE>I, measuring his affections by my own,</LINE>
        <LINE>That most are busied when they're most alone,</LINE>
        <LINE>Pursued my humour not pursuing his,</LINE>
        <LINE>And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Many a morning hath he there been seen,</LINE>
        <LINE>With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.</LINE>
        <LINE>Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;</LINE>
        <LINE>But all so soon as the all-cheering sun</LINE>
        <LINE>Should in the furthest east begin to draw</LINE>
        <LINE>The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,</LINE>
        <LINE>Away from the light steals home my heavy son,</LINE>
        <LINE>And private in his chamber pens himself,</LINE>
        <LINE>Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out</LINE>
        <LINE>And makes himself an artificial night:</LINE>
        <LINE>Black and portentous must this humour prove,</LINE>
        <LINE>Unless good counsel may the cause remove.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>My noble uncle, do you know the cause?</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>I neither know it nor can learn of him.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>


      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Have you importuned him by any means?</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Both by myself and many other friends:</LINE>
        <LINE>But he, his own affections' counsellor,</LINE>
        <LINE>Is to himself--I will not say how true--</LINE>
        <LINE>But to himself so secret and so close,</LINE>
        <LINE>So far from sounding and discovery,</LINE>
        <LINE>As is the bud bit with an envious worm,</LINE>
        <LINE>Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,</LINE>
        <LINE>Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.</LINE>
        <LINE>Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.</LINE>
        <LINE>We would as willingly give cure as know.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;</LINE>
        <LINE>I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>


      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,</LINE>
        <LINE>To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Good-morrow, cousin.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>


      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Is the day so young?</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>But new struck nine.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Ay me! sad hours seem long.</LINE>
        <LINE>Was that my father that went hence so fast?</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Not having that, which, having, makes them short.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>In love?</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>

        <SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Of love?</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Out of her favour, where I am in love.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,</LINE>
        <LINE>Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>


      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,</LINE>
        <LINE>Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!</LINE>
        <LINE>Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?</LINE>
        <LINE>Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.</LINE>
        <LINE>Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.</LINE>
        <LINE>Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!</LINE>
        <LINE>O any thing, of nothing first create!</LINE>
        <LINE>O heavy lightness! serious vanity!</LINE>
        <LINE>Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!</LINE>
        <LINE>Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,</LINE>
        <LINE>sick health!</LINE>
        <LINE>Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!</LINE>
        <LINE>This love feel I, that feel no love in this.</LINE>
        <LINE>Dost thou not laugh?</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>No, coz, I rather weep.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Good heart, at what?</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>ROMEO</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>


      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>At thy good heart's oppression.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>BENVOLIO</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Why, such is love's transgression.</LINE>
        <LINE>Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,</LINE>
        <LINE>Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest</LINE>
        <LINE>With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown</LINE>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.</LINE>
        <LINE>She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes</LINE>
        <LINE>In shape no bigger than an agate-stone</LINE>
        <LINE>On the fore-finger of an alderman,</LINE>
        <LINE>Drawn with a team of little atomies</LINE>
        <LINE>Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;</LINE>
        <LINE>Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,</LINE>
        <LINE>The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,</LINE>
        <LINE>The traces of the smallest spider's web,</LINE>
        <LINE>The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,</LINE>
        <LINE>Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,</LINE>
        <LINE>Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,</LINE>
        <LINE>Not so big as a round little worm</LINE>
        <LINE>Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;</LINE>
        <LINE>Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut</LINE>
        <LINE>Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,</LINE>
        <LINE>Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.</LINE>
        <LINE>And in this state she gallops night by night</LINE>
        <LINE>Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;</LINE>
        <LINE>O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,</LINE>
        <LINE>O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,</LINE>
        <LINE>O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,</LINE>
        <LINE>Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,</LINE>
        <LINE>Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:</LINE>
        <LINE>Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,</LINE>
        <LINE>And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;</LINE>
        <LINE>And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail</LINE>
        <LINE>Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,</LINE>
        <LINE>Then dreams, he of another benefice:</LINE>
        <LINE>Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,</LINE>
        <LINE>And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,</LINE>
        <LINE>Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,</LINE>
        <LINE>Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon</LINE>
        <LINE>Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,</LINE>
        <LINE>And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two</LINE>
        <LINE>And sleeps again. This is that very Mab</LINE>
        <LINE>That plats the manes of horses in the night,</LINE>
        <LINE>And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,</LINE>
        <LINE>Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:</LINE>
        <LINE>This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,</LINE>
        <LINE>That presses them and learns them first to bear,</LINE>
        <LINE>Making them women of good carriage:</LINE>
        <LINE>This is she--</LINE>

        <LINE>Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,</LINE>
        <LINE>Which is as thin of substance as the air</LINE>
        <LINE>And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes</LINE>
        <LINE>Even now the frozen bosom of the north,</LINE>
        <LINE>And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,</LINE>
        <LINE>Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.</LINE>

        <LINE>I fear, too early: for my mind misgives</LINE>
        <LINE>Some consequence yet hanging in the stars</LINE>
        <LINE>Shall bitterly begin his fearful date</LINE>
        <LINE>With this night's revels and expire the term</LINE>
        <LINE>Of a despised life closed in my breast</LINE>
        <LINE>By some vile forfeit of untimely death.</LINE>

        <LINE>If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:</LINE>

    </SCENE>

    <SCENE>
      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,</LINE>
        <LINE>Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,</LINE>
        <LINE>And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels</LINE>
        <LINE>From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:</LINE>
        <LINE>Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,</LINE>
        <LINE>The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,</LINE>
        <LINE>I must up-fill this osier cage of ours</LINE>
        <LINE>With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.</LINE>
        <LINE>The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;</LINE>
        <LINE>What is her burying grave that is her womb,</LINE>
        <LINE>And from her womb children of divers kind</LINE>
        <LINE>We sucking on her natural bosom find,</LINE>
        <LINE>Many for many virtues excellent,</LINE>
        <LINE>None but for some and yet all different.</LINE>
        <LINE>O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies</LINE>
        <LINE>In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:</LINE>
        <LINE>For nought so vile that on the earth doth live</LINE>
        <LINE>But to the earth some special good doth give,</LINE>
        <LINE>Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use</LINE>
        <LINE>Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:</LINE>
        <LINE>Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;</LINE>
        <LINE>And vice sometimes by action dignified.</LINE>
        <LINE>Within the infant rind of this small flower</LINE>
        <LINE>Poison hath residence and medicine power:</LINE>
        <LINE>For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;</LINE>
        <LINE>Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.</LINE>
        <LINE>Two such opposed kings encamp them still</LINE>
        <LINE>In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;</LINE>
        <LINE>And where the worser is predominant,</LINE>

        <LINE>Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine</LINE>

        <LINE>Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink</LINE>

        <LINE>Your high displeasure: all this uttered</LINE>
        <LINE>With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,</LINE>
        <LINE>Could not take truce with the unruly spleen</LINE>
        <LINE>Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts</LINE>
        <LINE>With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,</LINE>
        <LINE>Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,</LINE>
        <LINE>And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats</LINE>
        <LINE>Cold death aside, and with the other sends</LINE>
        <LINE>It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,</LINE>
        <LINE>Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,</LINE>
        <LINE>'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than</LINE>
        <LINE>his tongue,</LINE>
        <LINE>His agile arm beats down their fatal points,</LINE>
        <LINE>And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm</LINE>
        <LINE>An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life</LINE>
        <LINE>Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;</LINE>
        <LINE>But by and by comes back to Romeo,</LINE>
        <LINE>Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,</LINE>
        <LINE>And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I</LINE>

        <LINE>Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:</LINE>
        <LINE>Take thou this vial, being then in bed,</LINE>

        <LINE>When presently through all thy veins shall run</LINE>
        <LINE>A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse</LINE>
        <LINE>Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:</LINE>
        <LINE>No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;</LINE>
        <LINE>The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade</LINE>
        <LINE>To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,</LINE>
        <LINE>Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;</LINE>
        <LINE>Each part, deprived of supple government,</LINE>

        <LINE>Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes</LINE>
        <LINE>To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:</LINE>
        <LINE>Then, as the manner of our country is,</LINE>
        <LINE>In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier</LINE>
        <LINE>Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault</LINE>
        <LINE>Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.</LINE>
        <LINE>In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,</LINE>
        <LINE>Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,</LINE>

        <LINE>Is not so long as is a tedious tale.</LINE>
        <LINE>Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;</LINE>
        <LINE>And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:</LINE>
        <LINE>I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day</LINE>
        <LINE>Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death</LINE>
        <LINE>Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,</LINE>
        <LINE>For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.</LINE>
        <LINE>You, to remove that siege of grief from her,</LINE>
        <LINE>Betroth'd and would have married her perforce</LINE>
        <LINE>To County Paris: then comes she to me,</LINE>
        <LINE>And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean</LINE>
        <LINE>To rid her from this second marriage,</LINE>
        <LINE>Or in my cell there would she kill herself.</LINE>
        <LINE>Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,</LINE>
        <LINE>A sleeping potion; which so took effect</LINE>
        <LINE>As I intended, for it wrought on her</LINE>
        <LINE>The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,</LINE>
        <LINE>That he should hither come as this dire night,</LINE>
        <LINE>To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,</LINE>
        <LINE>Being the time the potion's force should cease.</LINE>
        <LINE>But he which bore my letter, Friar John,</LINE>
        <LINE>Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight</LINE>
        <LINE>Return'd my letter back. Then all alone</LINE>
        <LINE>At the prefixed hour of her waking,</LINE>
        <LINE>Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;</LINE>
        <LINE>Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,</LINE>
        <LINE>Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:</LINE>
        <LINE>But when I came, some minute ere the time</LINE>
        <LINE>Of her awaking, here untimely lay</LINE>
        <LINE>The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.</LINE>
        <LINE>She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,</LINE>
        <LINE>And bear this work of heaven with patience:</LINE>
        <LINE>But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;</LINE>
        <LINE>And she, too desperate, would not go with me,</LINE>
        <LINE>But, as it seems, did violence on herself.</LINE>
        <LINE>All this I know; and to the marriage</LINE>
        <LINE>Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this</LINE>
        <LINE>Miscarried by my fault, let my old life</LINE>
        <LINE>Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,</LINE>
        <LINE>Unto the rigour of severest law.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>FRIAR LAURENCE</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>We still have known thee for a holy man.</LINE>
        <LINE>Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>


      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>I brought my master news of Juliet's death;</LINE>
        <LINE>And then in post he came from Mantua</LINE>
        <LINE>To this same place, to this same monument.</LINE>
        <LINE>This letter he early bid me give his father,</LINE>
        <LINE>And threatened me with death, going in the vault,</LINE>
        <LINE>I departed not and left him there.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>BALTHASAR</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>Give me the letter; I will look on it.</LINE>
        <LINE>Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?</LINE>
        <LINE>Sirrah, what made your master in this place?</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>


      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;</LINE>
        <LINE>And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:</LINE>
        <LINE>Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;</LINE>
        <LINE>And by and by my master drew on him;</LINE>
        <LINE>And then I ran away to call the watch.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>This letter doth make good the friar's words,</LINE>
        <LINE>Their course of love, the tidings of her death:</LINE>
        <LINE>And here he writes that he did buy a poison</LINE>
        <LINE>Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal</LINE>
        <LINE>Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.</LINE>
        <LINE>Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!</LINE>
        <LINE>See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,</LINE>
        <LINE>That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.</LINE>
        <LINE>And I for winking at your discords too</LINE>
        <LINE>Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>PRINCE</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>O brother Montague, give me thy hand:</LINE>
        <LINE>This is my daughter's jointure, for no more</LINE>
        <LINE>Can I demand.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>But I can give thee more:</LINE>
        <LINE>For I will raise her statue in pure gold;</LINE>
        <LINE>That while Verona by that name is known,</LINE>
        <LINE>There shall no figure at such rate be set</LINE>
        <LINE>As that of true and faithful Juliet.</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>MONTAGUE</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;</LINE>
        <LINE>Poor sacrifices of our enmity!</LINE>
        <SPEAKER>CAPULET</SPEAKER>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <LINE>A glooming peace this morning with it brings;</LINE>
        <LINE>The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:</LINE>
        <LINE>Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;</LINE>
        <LINE>Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:</LINE>
        <LINE>For never was a story of more woe</LINE>
        <LINE>Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.</LINE>
