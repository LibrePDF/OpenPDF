		<div>
		  The RTF package is an extension of the iText library and allows iText
		  to output Rich Text Files in additon to PDF files. These files can then
		  be viewed and edited with RTF viewers such as Microsoft Word or OpenOffice.org
		  Writer.

		  The main class for generating RTF documents is the <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.rtf.RtfWriter2">RtfWriter2</site:doc>.
		  It supports most of iText's features with the exception of those features listed
		  under the <a href="#unsupported">unsupported features</a>. In addition to this
		  there are a number of extensions to the core iText classes that provide access
		  to RTF specific functionality:<br /><br />

        <site:sectiontitle>Introduction to RTF</site:sectiontitle>
        <div>
          RTF is the Rich Text Format developed by Microsoft with the aim of providing
          a cross-platform text-based document format. The main advantage that it has
          over PDF is that it can easily be edited with most word processing software.
          Its biggest disadvantage is that it is rendered by the word processing software
          when the RTF document is opened and not when the RTF document is generated.
          This leads to the situation that the document can look slightly different on
          different platforms.<br /><br />
          It is important to remember that RTF is a document description format and
          when iText creates a RTF document, only the description of the document is
          generated. NO RENDERING TAKES PLACE. It is thus impossible to provide access
          to such things as page numbers or page events.<br /><br />
          Apart from these considerations creating an RTF document works just like
          creating any other document with iText.

        <site:sectiontitle>Creating a basic RTF document</site:sectiontitle>
        <div>
          Creating a basic RTF document works just like creating a basic PDF document:
          <pre class="commandline">
Document document = new Document();
RtfWriter2.getInstance(document,
	new FileOutputStream("testRTFdocument.rtf"));
document.open();
document.add(new Paragraph("Hello World!"));
document.close();
          </pre>
          <site:source class="HelloWorld" />
          You can then use the objects described in <site:tutorial chapter="/" section="part2">Using High Level Objects</site:tutorial>
          to create more complex RTF documents.

    <site:section name="unsupported">
        <site:sectiontitle>Unsupported iText features</site:sectiontitle>
        <div>
          A number of iText features are not supported in the RtfWriter2 due to the fact
          that they either have not been implemented or are not supported by the
          RTF format itself. The following list may not be complete, since the development
          of the RtfWriter2 sometimes lags behind the development of the core library.<br />
