<div>
A Chunk is the smallest significant part of text that can be added to a document.
It is the 'atom' building block of most of the other High Level Text objects.
All the contents of a Chunk are of the same font, fontsize, style, color, etc...
In the following sections, all Chunk-functionality will be described:
</div>
	</site:section>
	
	<site:section name="underline">
		<site:sectiontitle>Adding lines under, through or above a Chunk</site:sectiontitle>
<div>
As you can read in the chapter on <site:tutorial chapter="/fonts" section="extrastyles">Fonts</site:tutorial>,
you can define the style as <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.Font" target="UNDERLINE">Font.UNDERLINE</site:doc> or
<site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.Font" target="STRIKETHRU">Font.STRIKETHRU</site:doc> to underline the text or
strike through it. This works for RTF and HTML, but in PDF, you get a lot more functionality if you use the method
<site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.Chunk" target="setUnderline(java.awt.Color,%20float,%20float,%20float,%20float,%20int)">Chunk.setUnderline</site:doc>.
There are two variations of this method:
<ul><li>
<site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.Chunk" target="setUnderline(float,%20float)">Chunk.setUnderline(float thickness, float yPosition)</site:doc> draws a line that has the
length of the Chunk, is <span class="commandline">thickness</span> points thick and positioned <span class="commandline">yPosition</span> above the baseline of the Chunk.
<pre class="commandline">Chunk underlined = new Chunk("underlined");
underlined.setUnderline(0.2f, -2f);
Chunk strikethru = new Chunk("strike through example");
strikethru.setUnderline(0.5f, 3f);</pre></li>
<li>
<site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.Chunk" target="setUnderline(java.awt.Color,%20float,%20float,%20float,%20float,%20int)">Chunk.setUnderline(Color color, float thickness, float thicknessMul, float yPosition, float yPositionMul, int cap)</site:doc>
lets you define the color of the line. You can set the absolute thickness and y postition with
<span class="commandline">thickness</span> and <span class="commandline">yPosition</span>,
but you can also let these values depend on the fontsize with
<span class="commandline">thicknessMul</span> and <span class="commandline">yPositionMul</span>.
In the example, the same Chunk with the same linedefinitions is written twice, but with a different
fontsize. As you can see, some lines vary along with the fontsize, others don't. This all depends
on the parameters that were passed with the method setUnderline.
Finally you can define the line cap style (see Table 4.4 in the PDF Reference Manual).<br />
<site:image source="linecap.gif">line cap styles</site:image>
<pre class="commandline">Chunk c = new Chunk("Multiple lines");
c.setUnderline(new Color(0xFF, 0x00, 0x00),
	0.0f, 0.3f, 0.0f, 0.4f,
	PdfContentByte.LINE_CAP_ROUND);
c.setUnderline(new Color(0x00, 0xFF, 0x00),
	5.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, -0.5f,
	PdfContentByte.LINE_CAP_PROJECTING_SQUARE);
c.setUnderline(new Color(0x00, 0x00, 0xFF),
	0.0f, 0.2f, 15.0f, 0.0f,
	PdfContentByte.LINE_CAP_BUTT);</pre></li></ul>
<site:source class="Lines" />
</div>
	</site:section>
	
	<site:section name="subsup">
		<site:sectiontitle>Sub- and Superscript</site:sectiontitle>
<div>
If you want to add a Chunk above or below the current y-position,
you can use the method <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.Chunk" target="setTextRise(float)">setTextRise</site:doc>.
In the example, we marked the baseline with <span class="commandline">c.setUnderline(new Color(0xC0, 0xC0, 0xC0), 0.2f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, PdfContentByte.LINE_CAP_BUTT);</span>
to demonstrate how a positive textrise puts text above the baseline and a negative textrise below.<br />
Note that 'underline' definitions are not affected by this value.
The underline has to follow the baseline otherwise mixing normal text
and superscript would cause a discontinuity. As for subscript: it doesn't
have much sense mixing it with underline text.
<site:source class="SubSupScript" />
</div>
	</site:section>
	
	<site:section name="background">
		<site:sectiontitle>Changing the background color</site:sectiontitle>
<div>
With the methods <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.Chunk" target="setBackground(java.awt.Color)">setBackground(Color color)</site:doc> and
<site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.Chunk" target="setBackground(java.awt.Color,%20float,%20float,%20float,%20float)">setBackground(Color color, float extraLeft, float extraBottom, float extraRight, float extraTop)</site:doc>,
you can change the background area of a Chunk (for instance to highlight a word). The first method fills the box that surrounds the Chunk,
with the second method, you can make the rectangle bigger or smaller.
<site:source class="Background" />
</div>
	</site:section>
	
	<site:section name="rendering">
		<site:sectiontitle>Stroking vs. Filling</site:sectiontitle>
<div>
In the PDF syntax characters (glyphs) are regarded as filled shapes.
If you want to change the color of a character, you change the
<site:tutorial chapter="/fonts/styles" section="styles">color of the font</site:tutorial>,
but in reality you change the 'fill' color. This is demonstrated in the example:
<site:source class="ChunkColor" />
With the method <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.Chunk" target="setTextRenderMode(int,%20float,%20java.awt.Color)">setTextRenderMode(int mode, float strokeWidth, Color strokeColor)</site:doc>,
you can also change the 'outline' of the text. As you can read in the chapters
on <site:tutorial chapter="" section="part4">direct content</site:tutorial>,
lines are not 'filled', but 'striken'. With the parameters <span class="commandline">strokeWidth</span>
and <span class="commandline">strokeColor</span>, you define the width and the color of the strokes
used to draw the character.<br />
The <span class="commandline">mode</span> parameter, can be one of the following values:
<ol>
<li><site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.PdfContentByte" target="TEXT_RENDER_MODE_FILL">PdfContentByte.TEXT_RENDER_MODE_FILL</site:doc>: glyphs will be filled (fontcolor), the strokeWidth and strokeColor don't play a role here.</li>
<li><site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.PdfContentByte" target="TEXT_RENDER_MODE_STROKE">PdfContentByte.TEXT_RENDER_MODE_STROKE</site:doc>: you will only see the outline of the glyphs, with the given strokeWidth and strokeColor.</li>
<li><site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.PdfContentByte" target="TEXT_RENDER_MODE_FILL_STROKE">PdfContentByte.TEXT_RENDER_MODE_FILL_STROKE</site:doc>: glyphs will be filled with the fontcolor and will have an outline with the given strokeWidth and strokeColor.</li>
<li><site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.PdfContentByte" target="TEXT_RENDER_MODE_INVISIBLE">PdfContentByte.TEXT_RENDER_MODE_INVISIBLE</site:doc>: the glyphs will be invisible.</li>
</ol>
This method can also be used to simulate a bold font (for instance if you are using a font that doesn't support
<site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.Font" target="BOLD">Font.Bold</site:doc>).
<site:source class="Rendering" />
</div>
	</site:section>

	<site:section name="skew">
		<site:sectiontitle>Skewing text</site:sectiontitle>
<div>
Method <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.Chunk" target="setSkew(float,%20float)">setSkew(float alpha, float beta)</site:doc> can be
used to simulate italic fonts (if you are using a font that doesn't support
<site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.Font" target="ITALIC">Font.ITALIC</site:doc>),
just take 0f as value for alfa and 12f as value for beta.<br />
Alfa is the angle of the baseline in degrees. In the example, we rotate some text
45f and -45f degrees. Beta is the square-angle on the baseline.
<site:source class="Skew" />
</div>

	<site:section name="generic">
		<site:sectiontitle>Generic functionality</site:sectiontitle>
<div>If all the features summed up above still doesn't answer your needs,
you can create your own functionality, using the PageEvent
<site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfPageEvent" target="onGenericTag(com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfWriter,%20com.lowagie.text.Document,%20com.lowagie.text.Rectangle,%20java.lang.String)">onGenericTag(PdfWriter writer,
Document document, Rectangle rect, String text)</site:doc>.
You can create your own class implementing the
<site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfPageEvent">PdfPageEvent</site:doc>-interface.
The best way to do this, is to extend the class <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfPageEventHelper">PdfPageEventHelper</site:doc>
and define some custom functionality, overriding the <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfPageEvent" target="onGenericTag(com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfWriter,%20com.lowagie.text.Document,%20com.lowagie.text.Rectangle,%20java.lang.String)">onGenericTag</site:doc>-method.
<pre class="commandline">public class Generic extends PdfPageEventHelper {
  public void onGenericTag(PdfWriter writer, Document document, Rectangle rect, String text) {
    // writer is the current writer to which the Chunk is written
    // document is the document to which the Chunk was added
    // rect is the area surrounding the Chunk
    // text is the text you passed with setGenericTag
  }
}</pre>
Don't forget to set the PageEvent:
<pre class="commandline">writer.setPageEvent(new Generic());</pre>
In the first example, we look at the text that is passed with the genericTag
(<site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.Chunk" target="setGenericTag(java.lang.String)">setGenericTag(String text)</site:doc>).
If this text equals to "ellipse", we draw an ellipse OVER the Chunk.
It we passed the word "box", we draw a rectangle UNDER the Chunk.
<pre class="commandline">public void onGenericTag(PdfWriter writer, Document document, Rectangle rect, String text) {
  if ("ellipse".equals(text)) {
    PdfContentByte cb = writer.getDirectContent();
    cb.setRGBColorStroke(0xFF, 0x00, 0x00);
    cb.ellipse(rect.left(), rect.bottom() - 5f, rect.right(), rect.top());
    cb.stroke();
    cb.resetRGBColorStroke();
  }
  else if ("box".equals(text)) {
    PdfContentByte cb = writer.getDirectContentUnder();
    rect.setGrayFill(0.5f);
    cb.rectangle(rect);
  }
}</pre>

to learn about the PDF syntax that gives you almost unlimited possibilities.
<site:source class="Generic" />
In the following example, we use the generic tag to keep a TreeMap of words
and we register the page on which the words were used. Once the document is completed,
we add an extra page, that gives us a glossary of words. It's a very simple example,
but with some changes, you can do a lot of really complex stuff with it.
<site:source class="Glossary" />
</div>
	</site:section>
	
	<site:section name="measure">
		<site:sectiontitle>Measuring and Scaling a Chunk</site:sectiontitle>
<div>
If you have a Chunk and you want to know it's width on a page,
you can use the method <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.Chunk" target="getWidthPoint()">getWidthPoint()</site:doc>.
It gives you the width in points and you will have to do
<site:tutorial chapter="/general/faq" section="measurements">maths</site:tutorial>
to know the width in inches or centimeters.<br/>
With the method <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.Chunk" target="setHorizontalScaling(float)">setHorizontalScaling(float scale)</site:doc>,
you can shrink (scale &lt; 1.0f) or expand (scale &gt; 1.0f) the Chunk.
In the example we first print the Chunk in its actual size,
then we print it twice at half its size (scale = 0.5f).
<site:source class="Width" />
</div>
	</site:section>

	<site:section name="endline">
		<site:sectiontitle>When the end of a line is reached</site:sectiontitle>
<div>
<div class="subtitle">Phrase</div>
If you keep on adding Chunks to a document, you reach the end of the line at a certain moment.
Of course, you haven't defined yet, what iText should do when this happens.
By default, iText performs a 'carriage return', but what about 'newline'?
How much space should iText take? The space between two (base)lines in a text,
is called 'leading' and you can't define it in class Chunk. You need other classes
such as <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.Paragraph">Paragraph</site:doc> for this
kind of stuff.<br />
In the following example we use the lesser known (and a little bit superfluous) class
<site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.Phrase">Phrase</site:doc>. A Phrase is a series of chunks
(that can have different styles) and with a certain leading as extra parameter.
Unlike class Paragraph, it doesn't know anything about indentation. The default fontsize
is 12, so we take a leading of 16. Take a look at the first page of the example:
all Chunks are written on the same line, over and over again. On the second page,
we added the same Chunks, but grouped in a Phrase with a leading of 16. When the
end of the line is reached, a new line is started.
<site:source class="EndOfLine" />
<div class="subtitle">SplitCharacter</div>
The default behaviour of iText, is to try to add as many 'complete words' to a line as possible.
iText will split sentences when a space or a hyphen is encountered. But what if the Chunk is longer than the
page width? In that case, iText will split the Chunk, just before the first character that doesn't
fit the page. In some cases, you don't want this to happen. You can avoid this by implementing
the interface <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.SplitCharacter">SplitCharacter</site:doc>
and add this class to the Chunk with <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.Chunk" target="setSplitCharacter(com.lowagie.text.SplitCharacter)">setSplitCharacter(SplitCharacter splitCharacter)</site:doc>.
You have to write your own <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.SplitCharacter" target="isSplitCharacter(int,%20int,%20int,%20char[],%20com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfChunk[])">isSplitCharacter</site:doc>,
which may seem rather complex at first sight. This is the default implementation:
<pre class="commandline">public boolean isSplitCharacter(int start, int current, int end, char[] cc, PdfChunk[] ck) {
   char c;
   if (ck == null)
       c = cc[current];
   else
       c = ck[Math.min(current, ck.length - 1)].getUnicodeEquivalent(cc[current]);
   if (c &lt;= ' ' || c == '-') {
       return true;
   }
   if (c &lt; 0x2e80)
       return false;
   return ((c &gt;= 0x2e80 &amp;&amp; c &lt; 0xd7a0)
   || (c &gt;= 0xf900 &amp;&amp; c &lt; 0xfb00)
   || (c &gt;= 0xfe30 &amp;&amp; c &lt; 0xfe50)
   || (c &gt;= 0xff61 &amp;&amp; c &lt; 0xffa0));
}</pre>
You can copy this method in your own <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.SplitCharacter">SplitCharacter</site:doc> implementation and make these small changes to have iText split words on dots and slashes too:
<pre class="commandline">if (c &lt;= ' ' || c == '-' || c == '.' || c == '/') {
    return true;
}</pre>
<site:source class="SplitChar" />
<div class="subtitle">Hyphenation</div>
To conclude this section, it is also possible to let iText hyphenate your
Chunks automatically. To achieve this, you have to create an instance of
the class <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.pdf.HyphenationAuto">HyphenationAuto</site:doc>:
<pre class="commandline">// Hyphenating a British text
Chunk ckEN = new Chunk(textEN);
HyphenationAuto autoEN = new HyphenationAuto("en", "GB", 2, 2);
ckEN.setHyphenation(autoEN);
// Hyphenating a Dutch text
Chunk ckNL = new Chunk(textNL);
HyphenationAuto autoNL = new HyphenationAuto("nl", null, 2, 2);
ckNL.setHyphenation(autoNL);</pre>
In the example, the same text (the introduction of Charles Dickens's epic Tale of Two Cities)
is hyphenated once according to UK-hyphenation rules and once according to US-hyphenation rules.
As you can see, there is a slight difference.<br />
Important remark: you need the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?groupname=itext&amp;filename=itext-hyph-xml.jar">itext-hyph-xml.jar</a> in your CLASSPATH
if you want to use this functionality. In this jar, you'll find files like:
<ul><li>en_GB.xml</li><li>en_US.xml</li><li>fr.xml</li><li>nl.xml</li></ul>
These files contain all the hyphenation rules that are specific for a certain language
(GB english, US english, French, Dutch,...). As you can see the first two parameters of the
<site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.pdf.HyphenationAuto" target="HyphenationAuto(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20int,%20int)">HyphenationAuto constructor</site:doc>
correspond with parts of the filename, the third and fourth parameter specify how
many characters may be 'orphaned' at the start of a word resp. at the end of a word.<br />
Remark that the XML files were not created by the iText developers.
The XML files were created for Apache FOP.
We have downloaded them and we have put them in a separate jar
for your convenience. Some of them may be GPL or not usable
for commercial purposes so, read the licenses and decide what to keep.<br />
If you can't find the hyphenation pattern you are looking for,
you can create your own as described at the
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/hyphenation.html">FOP</a> site.
Put your xml file as a resource in the package com.lowagie.text.pdf.hyphenation.hyph
or put the xml file in some directory and call <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.pdf.hyphenation.Hyphenator" target="setHyphenDir(java.lang.String)">Hyphenator.setHyphenDir()</site:doc>.
