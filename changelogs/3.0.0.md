# OpenPDF 3.0.0

## Major Change

- The 3.0.x Branch requires Java 24 or later.
- Package name changed from `com.lowagie` to `org.openpdf`.


- **Package name changed** from `com.lowagie` to `org.openpdf`.

 Clean up legacy code inherited from the iText 4.x fork. Refactor packages from com.lowagie to the new identity: org.openpdf.
 This change reflects the true identity of OpenPDF as a modern, community-driven PDF library 
 independent of the original iText 2.x (`com.lowagie`). It avoids conflicts and 
 clarifies project ownership going forward.
