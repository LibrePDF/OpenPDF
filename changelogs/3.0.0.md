## OpenPDF 3.0.0 

* OpenPDF 3.0.0 uses the new package name **org.openpdf**. The old com.lowagie is now removed from OpenPDF 3.0.
This means that source code using OpenPDF must be migrated to use import statements using org.openpdf.* package.

* **PDF 2.0 support in OpenPDF** â€“ This is a **breaking API change**:  
  All version-related methods now use `String` instead of `char` as method parameters.   See [PdfVersion.java](https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/blob/master/openpdf-core/src/main/java/org/openpdf/text/pdf/interfaces/PdfVersion.java) and [PdfWriter.java](https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/blob/master/openpdf-core/src/main/java/org/openpdf/text/pdf/PdfWriter.java#L154).
  The default version is now **PDF 2.0**.

  **About PDF 2.0:**
