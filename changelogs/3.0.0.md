## OpenPDF 3.0.0 

* OpenPDF 3.0.0 uses the new package name **org.openpdf**. The old com.lowagie is now removed from OpenPDF 3.0.
This means that source code using OpenPDF must be migrated to use import statements using org.openpdf.* package.

* Full PDF 2.0 support in OpenPDF. This is a breaking API change where all version related methods now use
String instead of char as method parameters. Default version is now PDF 2.0.

* Added Html2PdfBatchUtils and PdfBatchUtils, new batch utilities built on Java 21 virtual threads. 
These APIs improve throughput for HTMLâ†’PDF rendering and common PDF tasks such as merge, split, watermark, and encrypt.
