## OpenPDF 3.0.0 

* OpenPDF 3.0.0 uses the new package name org.openpdf. The old com.lowagie is not in use in OpenPDF 3.0.
This means that source code using OpenPDF must be migrated to use import statements using org.openpdf.* package.

* Full PDF 2.0 support in OpenPDF. This is a breaking API change where all version related methods now use
String instead of char as method parameters. Default version is now PDF 2.0.
