## [2.1.0] (circa year 2026)

### Changes
- OpenPDF 2.1.0 requires Java 21.
- New OpenPDF Kotlin module, for Kotlin development.
- HTML parsing has been removed from OpenPDF, because it was such an outdated, poor HTML parser. 
  We encourage migrating to Flyingsaucer or JSoup. This includes the classes HtmlParser, SAXmyHtmlHandler
  and other classes in the com.lowagie.text.html package. A modern HTML parser for OpenPDF might be added later.
