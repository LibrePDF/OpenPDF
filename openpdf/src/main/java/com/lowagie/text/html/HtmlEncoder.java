/**
 * This class converts a <CODE>String</CODE> to the HTML-format of a String.
 * <p>
 * To convert the <CODE>String</CODE>, each character is examined:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>ASCII-characters from 000 till 031 are represented as &amp;#xxx;<BR>
 * (with xxx = the value of the character)
 * <LI>ASCII-characters from 032 t/m 127 are represented by the character itself, except for:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>'\n'    becomes &lt;BR&gt;\n
 * <LI>&quot; becomes &amp;quot;
 * <LI>&amp; becomes &amp;amp;
 * <LI>&lt; becomes &amp;lt;
 * <LI>&gt; becomes &amp;gt;
 * </UL>
 * <LI>ASCII-characters from 128 till 255 are represented as &amp;#xxx;<BR>
 * (with xxx = the value of the character)
 * </UL>

 * Example:

 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
 * String htmlPresentation = HtmlEncoder.encode("Marie-Th&#233;r&#232;se S&#248;rensen");
