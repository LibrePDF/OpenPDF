/**
 * Beginning with BaseVersion 1.7, the extensions dictionary lets developers designate that a given document contains
 * extensions to PDF. The presence of the extension dictionary in a document indicates that it may contain
 * developer-specific PDF properties that extend a particular base version of the PDF specification. The extensions
 * dictionary enables developers to identify their own extensions relative to a base version of PDF. Additionally, the
 * convention identifies extension levels relative to that base version. The intent of this dictionary is to enable
 * developers of PDF-producing applications to identify company-specific specifications (such as this one) that
 * PDF-consuming applications use to interpret the extensions.
