/**
 * <CODE>PdfResources</CODE> is the PDF Resources-object.
 * <p>
 * The marking operations for drawing a page are stored in a stream that is the value of the
 * <B>Contents</B> key in the Page object's dictionary. Each marking context includes a list
 * of the named resources it uses. This resource list is stored as a dictionary that is the value of the context's
 * <B>Resources</B> key, and it serves two functions: it enumerates the named resources in the contents stream, and it
 * established the mapping from the names to the objects used by the marking operations.<BR> This object is described in
 * the 'Portable Document Format Reference Manual version 1.3' section 7.5 (page 195-197).
