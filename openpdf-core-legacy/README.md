## OpenPDF core legacy - Deprecated

Open and Free PDF library. It uses the old package name `com.lowagie`.

 Please migrate to `openpdf-core-modern` (package `org.openpdf.*`). 

* [Openpdf-core-legacy](/openpdf-core-legacy) - Maven artifactId: openpdf. This is the legacy OpenPDF core package, 
  which uses the old Java package name `com.lowagie`. This will be removed in the future, so please migrate.
* [Openpdf-core-modern](/openpdf-core-modern) - Maven artifactId: openpdf-core-modern. This is the modern OpenPDF 
  core package, which uses the new Java package name `org.openpdf`. This is the recommended package to use in new code.

## Notes:
- Bug-fixes only, don't add new features to this.
