**iText is a Java PDF library originally dual licensed under MPL/LGPL**

This fork of https://github.com/ymasory/iText-4.2.0 manages the sources as Maven project.

I added a pngnow.png file and changed the path in Rtftest.java so the package tests cleanly.

This package cleanly builds.
I have added myself as one of the developers and we have forked this from the kloni/iText-4.2.0 fork on github

I will add kloni (Tom Klonikowski and Yuvi Masory as developers as well) just to show the lineage of where the package came from and provide credit where it is due.
